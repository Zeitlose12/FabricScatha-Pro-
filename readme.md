# Fabric Scatha-Pro (Unofficial Fabric Port for 1.21.5)

This is an unofficial Fabric port of the Scatha-Pro mod for Minecraft 1.21.5 by Zeitlose (Jan).
It brings the classic Scatha-Pro experience to modern Minecraft versions and adds several quality-of-life improvements.

Highlights in this port
- Fabric 1.21.5 support (Java 21)
- Reworked Settings UI with clear tabs (Overlay, Achievements, News, Alerts, Sound)
- Overlay settings with 2-column layout, sections, and scrolling
- Achievements view: compact rows, 2-column categories, progress bars, proper clipping/scrolling
- Alerts tab: alert mode switching (Vanilla/Meme/Anime/Custom), Bedrock-wall trigger distance, test buttons
- Custom Mode Editor: per-alert title, sound mapping, per-alert volume, quick test play, JSON export
- No blurred backgrounds in GUIs for crisp titles
